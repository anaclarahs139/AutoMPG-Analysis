Welcome to the AutoMPG Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing and predicting fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, or mpg) using linear regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) on the StatLib Auto dataset from 1983. In this README, you'll find a detailed overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and how to get started.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the fuel efficiency of automobiles and build predictive models that can estimate mpg based on various features of the cars. This analysis can help manufacturers and consumers make informed decisions about fuel consumption and environmental impact.

By leveraging statistical techniques such as linear regression and GAM, we aim to uncover relationships within the data that contribute to fuel efficiency. This project serves as both a practical application of data analysis techniques and a learning resource for those interested in statistical modeling.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this analysis is the StatLib Auto dataset, which contains various attributes of automobiles from 1983. The key features include:

- **mpg**: Miles per gallon (the target variable)
- **cylinders**: Number of cylinders in the engine
- **displacement**: Engine displacement in cubic inches
- **horsepower**: Engine horsepower
- **weight**: Weight of the car in pounds
- **acceleration**: Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph
- **model year**: Year of the model
- **origin**: Origin of the car (USA, Europe, or Japan)

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of automobile characteristics that influence fuel efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between features and mpg.
- **Subset Selection**: Identify the most relevant features for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Implement linear regression and GAM models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Create insightful visualizations to illustrate findings.

## Installation

To get started with the AutoMPG Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaclarahs139/AutoMPG-Analysis.git
   cd AutoMPG-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have R installed on your machine. Then, install the necessary R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "mgcv", "caret"))
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**:
   You can download the dataset from the following link: [Download Releases](https://github.com/anaclarahs139/AutoMPG-Analysis/releases). Make sure to place the dataset in the appropriate directory as specified in the project files.

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the following R script:

```R
source("analysis.R")
```

This script will perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The results will be saved in the output directory.

## Analysis Process

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this project, we perform the following tasks:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and impute or remove missing data points.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalize or standardize features as needed.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may improve model performance.

### Correlation Analysis

Understanding the relationships between variables is essential. We use correlation matrices and visualizations to identify which features are most strongly related to mpg. This analysis helps in selecting the most relevant features for modeling.

### Subset Selection

Not all features contribute equally to model performance. We employ techniques such as stepwise regression to select a subset of features that provide the best predictive power. This reduces model complexity and enhances interpretability.

### Model Development

We implement two modeling approaches:

1. **Linear Regression**: A straightforward approach that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
2. **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)**: A more flexible modeling technique that allows for non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response variable.

### Model Evaluation

After training the models, we evaluate their performance using metrics such as:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides a measure of how far predictions deviate from actual values.
- **R-squared**: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Visualizations such as residual plots and prediction vs. actual plots help assess model performance.
